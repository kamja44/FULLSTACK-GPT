      "Great choice! Indian cuisine is known for its bold flavors and aromatic spices. Let's start with a classic and easy-to-make dish - Chicken Tikka Masala. Here's a simple recipe for you to try at home:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan bread (to serve)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, half of the minced garlic, half of the grated ginger, and a pinch of salt. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Stir in the tomato sauce, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Add the cooked chicken tikka pieces to the sauce and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over cooked rice or with naan bread. Garnish with chopped cilantro.\n",
      "\n",
