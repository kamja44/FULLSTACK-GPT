      "Frozen is a popular animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. It was released in 2013 and is based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale \"The Snow Queen.\" The film follows the story of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, who live in the kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa has magical ice powers that she struggles to control, leading her to accidentally plunge the kingdom into eternal winter. Anna sets out on a journey to find her sister and save Arendelle with the help of an ice harvester named Kristoff, his loyal reindeer Sven, and a comical snowman named Olaf. Frozen was a critical and commercial success, winning two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for \"Let It Go.\" It spawned a sequel, Frozen II, which was released in 2019. The franchise also includes merchandise, theme park attractions, and a Broadway musical adaptation.\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m[llm/end]\u001b[0m \u001b[1m[1:llm:ChatOpenAI] [2.63s] Exiting LLM run with output:\n",
